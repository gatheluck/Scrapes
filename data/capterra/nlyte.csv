The efforts to load the Nlyte with data was a significant challenge, but was absolutely worth every moment spent.  Training is recommended for effective use, because Nlyte in not immediately intuitive to use in all its modules.  While some may consider this a con, I considerate it a feature as protecting the integrity of the Nlyte database is a major concern and Nlyte walks a line between ease of use protecting data from changes by a novice.Pros: Nlyte provides a comprehensive source to help me answer all of the questions that customers ask involving data center services.  Mundane asset information is easily searchable, while diagrams and pictures are immediately available to facilitate descriptions to customers who may never actually set foot in the data center.  Nlyte is a resources that has improved the communication of my enterprise for every person that needs to know anything about physical hardware to get a task done.Cons: Loading the data that Nlyte will use is a significant undertaking.  While Nlyte provides this as a service, security concerns kept my enterprise from taking advantage.   At least 1200 hundred man-hours were spent to load the information from 10,000 assets, just to give an idea of the scope of implementing this solution.Alternatives Considered: Cormant-CS DCIM and Sunbird DCIMReasons for Choosing Nlyte DCIM: Research and peer reviews were the biggest contributors to choosing Nlyte, but the addition modules that will link VMware and Remedy put Nlyte over the top.Reasons for Switching to Nlyte DCIM: The homemade java-script program that was previously used proved the facility of a comprehensive data base of the data center, so that my bosses would pay for a professional tool.Reviewer Source Source: CapterraJune 23, 2020"

Power from the Utility down to the switched outlet with audit trails, to all the interdependencies of the loaded software, data connections and management with move plan-o-grams to give the techs.Cons: As with most of these applications it is very cerebral in being able to visualize your environment in the forms presented, initial user training is a real paradigm shift for those who don't live in the cabinets.  If it had a graphical drag and drop creation methodology that would help a lot toward user intuitiveness of operation.  Wish list?  direct DWG import for rooms would be nice. Alternatives Considered: Trellis Site Manager, Simplicity and RAMP DCIMReasons for Choosing Nlyte DCIM: it was the most mature of those we looked at and also best matched our needs from a floor modeling and business operations with the least amount of current process interdictionReasons for Switching to Nlyte DCIM: We outgrew the capabilities and did not want to invest in the development and continued maintenance to better match our changing needs.Reviewer Source Source: CapterraMay 22, 2020"

Nice idea, poorly implemented and even more poorly supported.Pros: Very customizable, however you have to customize about everything.  Nice idea for a product, but poorly implemented, worsely supported and highly over pricedCons: Support has a slow response time.  Everything has to be customized and support is not much help.  Manuals are poorly written.  If you have a problem, they might call it a feature request and it will never get looked at again.  If you see something in their demos, it will probably cost another 50k.  They like to charge and overcharge for everything.

Adopting Nlyte brought us into the 21st-century by giving us the tools and capabilities that should be standard across the industry for all data center service providers and colocation customers. Pros: The ease of visualizing our data center assets to customers and administrators offsite, and tracking our cabling configuration between the assets. Cons: Either there's no ability to open a new service request through Nlyte directly from the asset page, or it's not intuitive to see how that could be enabled.Alternatives Considered: Sunbird DCIMReasons for Choosing Nlyte DCIM: Instead of providing an API to build our own connectors between applications, Nlyte offered the software solutions themselves. Reasons for Switching to Nlyte DCIM: Nlyte gave us essential capabilities and tools that weren't available but desperately needed from our in-house solution.

However, it sometimes presents a mountain to climb when trying to gain usage of deeper held features.  I think, too, response may be impacted by the workload that underlies Windows 10.  This would reflect negatively on Nlyte.Pros: Scope and completeness of feature coverageCons: Too often instructions and tips are written from the point of view of  personnel very familiar with the inner working and technology behind the product.  This shows up as acronyms not explained,  or inconsistency in terminology usage.  A terminology  analogy  would be to be directed to  click on a button named ""James"" but finding only buttons named  ""Jim""  and ""Joe"".  This happens too often in many places other than Nlyte. as well.  The user interface must be written from the point of view of a naive first time user.

Being able to show business owners a 3D model of their racks, along with the monitoring of power, space, heat and available U space, adds confidence and allows migrations to happen with fewer reservations. Pros: Nlyte gives administrators the ability to update changes in bulk, allowing for large datasets to be created in minutes or hours rather than days or weeks. I was able to map the power chain (UPS-Generator-PDU-Panel-beakers-circuits-receptacles-rack power strips) for a large data center in about an hour. Global data center migrations are now much easier than before, when spreadsheets were the norm.Cons: I'd like to see better integration between the NAO and NEO GUIs. If it were one seamless GUI, and the NEO monitoring functions were more intuitive, that would be a huge win. NEO can be a daunting GUI to get working correctly.Reasons for Choosing Nlyte DCIM: The NAO interface and 3D modeling was far above any competitor's GUI.

I would suggest that they speak to other customers using the product to get a real view on what Nlyte can provide. I seen the other negative review and I am not sure they received the good review of the product line. I also would like to say that Nlyte is not like the big players offering the same solutions. They are able to provide better support and updates quicker than the larger player in the industry. I like that I can speak to the CTO of the company at any time and share my ideas and feedback. Pros: I have been a Nlyte customer for over 5 years and I am using it's asset management and environmental monitoring tools (NAO & NEO). I have both integrated into my CMBD allowing me to pass CI data and providing updated records for ticket resolution. I like the easy of use related to customizing the applications. I also find the support to be very responsive and knowledgeable. Cons: Would like to see easier integration related to API configuration. I have seen other apps and they also have the same challenge.
