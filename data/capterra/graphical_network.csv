Easier to use then trying to document with visio or excel. I like the point to point connections that can be hidden when not actively in use. Great for diving down or high level look.Cons: That we aren't buying more enhancements and licenses. Otherwise a great product. Keep up the good work.Reviewer Source Source: CapterraMarch 2, 2018"

The collector function of the software is outstanding when rolling in new Data Centers, or network closets. The support offered on any issue it utterly astounding. They are so involved in the good of the company at one point the president of the company actually came out to train our team.  I highly recommend the product, as well as the people.Cons: There have not been any cons to this product that I have been made aware of to this point. They work with the admins as well as the developers on a totally equally level. Reviewer Source Source: CapterraSeptember 4, 2020"

Since netTerrain  supports Inter diagram links and cables, it would be nice if OSPF would support that too.  * The excel bulk import functionality is not as intuitive because the column mapping uses generic labeling. I would like to have a drag and drop mapping functionality like the Integration Toolkit has. * The tool is packed with nifty functions and tricks but some of them are buried in the documentation or need to be clarified through support Reviewer Source Source: CapterraMarch 5, 2018"
