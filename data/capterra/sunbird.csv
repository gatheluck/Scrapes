Started with PowerIQ 11 years ago and recently migrated from Aperture to dcTrack.    Starting with PowerIQ I have to say I love the Buffered Data Retrieval feature that provides a min, avg and max reading from a timestamp sample you define.  This has proven to be very useful data.     PowerIQ also has a Sensors Tab that I'm happy to say I submitted the NFR for.  This tab allows users to easily manage their Temperature Sensors, providing the ability to utilize Global or Local Thresholds.  Recently the addition of Inlets and Circuit Breakers have been added to this Tab.  dcTrack has a lot of great features but the best feature by far is the Auto Power Budget Feature.  This too I worked with Sunbird to create.  It provides Deployment and Facilities Engineers with a Potential Power Load that is based off of Trend Policies defined by the Users.  In my opinion it provides the most realistic power consumption from your devices on the Market.  If you have not seen this in action you should contact Sunbird for a Demonstration right away.   As it pertains to Support, Sunbird is remarkable!   They respond to all Tickets in a timely manner and work hard to resolve them.Cons: With all the great features Sunbird provides, the one thing I have an issue with is all the bugs we find after a new version is released.  Although they are quick to resolve them there are far too many.  I would like to see them beef up their Quality Assurance Program.Reasons for Switching to Sunbird DCIM: The version of Aperture we had installed was nearing EOL.

I haven't discovered anything we would miss at work yet.  You can build custom dashboards, DC rooms in 3D, rack overviews, power- and data-connections and more so that everyone can get an insight without being in the room.  For the operation of a data center a DCIM software solution is absolutely necessary. The tasks today are very varied and it is easy to lose track. With dcTrack you can get the overview back. Of course there is a lot of work behind it but you should start with the work. There won't be a 100% solution but if you know what you want and take the first step, you will see that it goes forward.Pros: The support is great and you always get help and solutions for problems.  The insertion of racks, devices, PDUs and connections is possible by bulk import and therefore fast and clear.  You can create different roles for each user and assign rights for each user.  You can plan very well in advance and then display it virtually as it might look. Work orders can also be created and documented. I have already taken part on a user group meetings where wishes, problems, user questions are answered and solutions are sought. One is kept up to date about new developments and there is user training on demand.Cons: There aren't really any disadvantages with these tools, just the complexity that exists, let you sometimes ask what you do first and what can waiting for.  You should make sure that all users are involved in different tasks.Vendor ResponseBy Sunbird on October 18, 2019Thank you for your positive feedback.

I dont' have enough characters here to list everything I like about this software. I'll sum it up like this, all of the questions/requirements you may have for your system, that start with, ""can I do ______ with this system?"", the answer is yes. Some features are harder than others to get setup. Power connectivity, for instance, takes into account your building's entire power chain. From the building UPS, up to your rack PDU's, utilizing any available management information those devices will offer up. Unless you know a lot about industrial power (I do not) then it could be a difficult feature to get working. That being said I was able to get things up and running with a Sunbird support staff who are not just extremely knowledgeable of their applications, but have expertise in every facet of every infrastructure area that the system supports.  The applications are also visually stunning that they are easy sells to management and are ""no-brianers"" to justify for purchase.Cons: My biggest complaint about the software is a development paradigm of dictating what can be done or not in the system, even if you may feel like you should be able to proceed with an operation. An example of this is that the system, when implemented as deigned will not allow you to make a network connection between a SFP port of a switch and a copper NIC. This, even though these connections are possible using copper GBIC's. There is a workaround for this, of making all of your different port-types to ""twisted-pair"" which constitutes a minor inconvenience.  The important thing is that the Sunbird Support staff have always come up with a work around for the particular incompatibilities in our environment, of which there have not been many.Vendor ResponseBy Sunbird on October 19, 2019Tony - thank you for the positive feedback and great insight.

It helps the Operations team find devices quickly, without having to look in multiple places for where assets should be. Sunbird has created a do it all tool that works, it does what it says it will do and the level of support you get with it is first rate. I can use my DCIM tool to help keep track of network ports, and empty cabinet space and run power reports.... the uses and possibilities are endless. Pros: The Visualization of my datacenter floor. i find myself in it all day going cabinet to cabinet. This portion of the tool gives you 3d CAD rendering of your datacenter that you can quickly click on a cabinet and take you to the device you are looking for. This feature also is very useful is seeing cabinet temps, power usage when paired with smart PDU's oh and one of my all time favorite features in this Visualization feature is the ability to measure out cable. You can click on measure in the menu and then click a point on your datacenter map then trace out where your cable will run and go point to point. It gives you an accurate distance so you know which cable lengths you will be using. Just one of the many various useful elements of dcTrack. Cons: I do not have many issues or complaints with regard to dcTrack. The issues I do come across tend to be buggy new release issues that once called into the Sunbird Support Team, it's handled and rectified quickly. For example there was an issue with having to load up Adobe Flash when opening a certain tab in the software. The issue was isolated to this one tab and only when using Chrome did it come up. The Sunbird team was quick to correct this and on the next software update release, it was addressed.

In many implementations with software and other DCIM providers this has by far been the best experience we have had. The support is quick and direct, usually solving issues and answering questions on the first contact and typically in the same day. The team members providing instruction in remote sessions were knowledgeable and took the time to make sure we understood the functionality and how to repeat it. The product is great and fits all of our requirements; where there was not a direct process for an integration with other tools, the Sunbird team was quick to assist. The Sunbird software is easy to use, integrates with other products easily and the GUI is very clean. After demonstrations and comparison to 6 other competitors, Sunbird products stood out well above the rest. Pros: What we like most about Sunbird's DCIM solution is the integration between dcTracks and PowerIQ along with the great features, detailed user interface and ease of use. The software is setup in a way that is very intuitive to use and just as easy to implement from image to production use. The implementation/proof of concept team was great to work with. The weekly sessions made sure we were able to achieve all our requirements and not only assisted in setting up the software but showed the team how accomplish the tasks on our own so that we could replicate and update our data as needed.Cons: At this point there is not much that we dislike about the software. It contains all the features and ease of use we expected; and more. We would like an additional feature for integration with server cabinet door locks to see the status; if they were open/closed and who accessed the rack based on badge.

I like the direction the software is heading by moving more features and functionality to the web client and away from classic view. I really like sort and filter functionality as well as the import / export feature that can be used with Microsoft Excel. A built-in models library is very helpful and has saved us a bunch of time. Pros: Import / export functionality along with the sort and filter. When setting up the power infrastructure, I like that it is a physical representation of the plugs to outlet in that a L22-30P needs to be plugged into an L22-30R and that the software understands that a different plug or receptacle wouldn't physically plug in. There are numerous checks and balances like this that are helpful. Cons: The separation of features between the web client and classic view. It can also be confusing to understand what features are in PowerIQ opposed to DcTrack. Making them better integrated would be helpful. It would be nice if the models library updates were more proactive vs reactive. For example, when Dell released their Rx30 lineup, it would be nice to have the R330, R430, R530, etc.. automatically added without having to put in a request since Dell is such a big player in this field. I understand it can't be done for every make / model but for the big manufacturers core lineup that would help. Software doesn't natively work with Chrome, the use of extensions doesn't always work properly. Recommendations to other buyers: Would be a nice feature if you could use variables when using the sort and filter feature, such as R*30 if I wanted a list of all devices matching R330, R430, R530.  Would like to add an additional color or two to the floor maps such as orange to allow for us to represent different health states. Green, yellow, and red doesn't allow us to customize our logic on the back end well enough. Vendor ResponseBy Sunbird on December 17, 2019Thank you for your positive feedback.

Collating and matching data to dcTracks standards is very challenging for the project team. We are going to use your turn key service to ease the process.Reasons for Choosing Sunbird DCIM: dcTrack was great from the presentation. Implementation needs work on the customer communication and ""hand holding"" a bit because your system is a beast and needs a driving licence to run. That's also what is great about it , you have presented a lot of functionality in a clear and accessible way. Some improvements in the UI are always needed but this should be the standard part of your budget's R&D side.  The future of datacentres is full automation + AI what is so widely overhyped nowadays and is nothing but a bunch of algorithms with no self consciousness. Nonetheless the future software that will run it will be integrated from the hardware delivery/deployment automation to the software deployment level. Full monitoring will be in place and a policy driven ""AI"" decisioning system in place. As you can see the future ""software"" will be a single entity. That's why Sunbird will play it's cards right partnering and integrating the most advanced solutions on the market.

As a Shared Services provider, we can easily demonstrate to existing customers where their racks are located, how populated they are, etc.  This is also useful in sales initiatives;  having a 3-D graph of racks with available capacity (one of the vendor-provided reports) makes the salesman's job easier. Pros: I like the fact that it can be as high-level, or granulated as you like. I initially started with ""where are my racks and what's in them"" usage, easily generating 3-d visuals, and exporting .csv and .pdf reports.  Using the built-in import and export tools, I've been able to add entries for power whips (and associate them with racks),  and populate chassis with individual blades.  Next steps will be to update network information for devices, again, with the easy import tools.Cons: The models library sometimes lacks the specific Make, Model, etc. of a device I'm adding, so I'll have to use a similar one, or define a generic one.

The support teams are always responsive and your first line of defense seems to have easy access to next level engineers which is rare to see however is a huge plus to us when we have problems to deal with. In some cases however, the first level of support clearly does not know a portion of the product and the case needs to be immediately dumped to engineers. Case in point is the rollout of VM Manager integration in version 6.x. As soon as it came out, we started using it and immediately ran into problems of which first level support had not even seen the new enhancement. Pros: Ease of workflow. Simple and intuitive and my team has been able to quickly pickup the process of using it with little direction. We appreciate Sunbird taking responsibility for maintaining a catalog of assets. We love the 3D visualization aspect and that we can spin the cabinet around and isolate cabinets.Cons: The visualization maps are really rough to look at and often look like a high school drafting project from the 80's. I can create beautiful looking maps in Visio but importing them from Visio to a cad file, then importing them into dcTrack looks like garbage.

BUT every manager who decides to have this tool should have in mind that this tool needs People and time to get it started and when it has started you may be Need a bit more time to Keep it running. We have learned so much concerning our own workflows in our datacenters and  in my eyes it works great and I wouldn't change it for another DCIM tool, anyway. It worth every second and every cent we have spent on it and are still doing.Pros: The deeper you dive into the dcTrack universe the bigger it seems to grow. If you have internalised your own processes, this tool is indispensable for the administration of your own datacenters and each Piece of hardware built-in there.Cons: Sometime I wish the tool could be cut down to our specific Needs but then we would have to ask ourselves what these needs are. The complexity of the tool, which is of course just an image of reality, sometimes makes it difficult to start with it.Vendor ResponseBy Sunbird on December 16, 2019Thank you for your positive feedback.

It now can do a lot of the tasks that I need it too. Pros: DC Track makes it very easy to search a lot of different ways and does not allow the typical typos or duplicates that you get when using Excel. It has not been 100% but light years better than ExcelCons: The time it takes to use the tool as a stand alone software. A lot of guys are still using Excel and importing into the tool. This makes common input errors a norm. Recommendations to other buyers: As the tool develops adding in more logic that will decrease the time to build in the tool will help us greatly. A lot of these issues were covered in the Denver conference on June 16th. I look forward to seeing the new developments that come out of that working session.   I did have 4 stars on the ease of use and for some reason it dropped to 2 and will not let me change it!Vendor ResponseBy Sunbird on December 17, 2019Thank you for your positive feedback.

Easy to use with intelligent and clear reporting and helpful dashboards. We've grown and developed our business processes and procedures while implementing the tool - moving away from manual data entry and management via multiple spreadsheets is the thing of the past we'd never go back to.Cons: With every release there are always new features delivered that were requested by the customers.

With the cabinet views, I can 'see' the best areas to place equipment within a cabinet without the need to be physically on site. Device views allows me to 'show' Installers where exactly the various device ports are located so they connect data cables correctly. The floor plan allows me to estimate distances so I can order cables of proper length. All of these views are invaluable to me since I support remote data centers.Cons: That I still need to access Classic View to preform some functions.

If your knowledge of Datacenter components and operations is good, you can learn its usage in a very short time and define the new hardware models in 15 minutes without waiting for support. With the CSV upload feature, you can save a serious time by organizing updates in Excel that will last longer. End-to-end cable tracking is really successful. With access to the database via ODBC, you can prepare advanced reports and integrate with other applications. Payment is more flexible than other companies. Monthly usage is also possible. Unit prices are public on the web-site.Cons:  Each circuit has to be terminated with an endpoint.

The support the Sunbird team provides is also excellent with extremely fast response times and vast knowledge - whether it'll be adding a new model or the rare error code, the team is on it.Cons: The least thing I like about this software is the fact it's broken down into two different parts.

In the meanwhile our Datacenter team knows more about the rooms, climate, power consumption than our facility management. The functionality for reporting is very powerful and can automatically sent them to the persons, that need it.Cons: Because the software is so powerful, there are a lot of things you have to configure.
