It has allowed us to keep track of a very dynamic environment and ultimately improved user workflows. These types of benefits improve our quality of work and allow us to save time in many ways for other aspects of our business.Pros: One of the best things about Device42 is their amazing customer support; they are very quick to address issues and are always implementing feature improvements. Device42 also offers a one-stop-shop for all things DCIM, a robust IPAM, Password management, and additional add-ons such as power monitoring that has ultimately helped improve our workflow and organizational capabilities. Their auto-discovery tools are quite in-depth at pulling information from our devices. Cons: With all software, there will be bugs and issues to workout, but Device42's willingness to tackle and improve upon their platform constantly is what keeps us coming back. Auto-discovery can be difficult to implement depending on the complexity of the environment but the addition of remote collectors has definitely helped.Reviewer Source Source: CapterraMay 21, 2018"

Does a good job at both and the value for money is there. Support has been very helpful, development seems overworked - don't except a quick resolution to the issues that are present.  Would definitely recommend the product.  As a side note, they are offering cash payouts for five star reviews, so I'd encourage taking any reviews with a grain of salt.Pros: The feature set is decently well thought out and it does what it says on the tin. We rolled it out to cover 1200 devices (60 or so models) inside if two months, which is a very good clip - most stuff worked out of the box and we managed to work around annoying (but minor) issues to get workflow integration going.Cons: The UI is the weakest point, both in terms of usage and documentation - a good portion of it is undocumented or under documented.  The password vault offering may be useful in some scenarios but is insecure by design, would not store anything actually sensitive in it.  If you use bonding/port channels, expect that most of the network visualisation breaks down.Reviewer Source Source: CapterraMarch 23, 2019"

The dependency chart is  appreciated by our change manager. Pros: Great tool with many features, you can start with one area and populate it and then move on to next area until all is linked together. We started with the IPAM area to get away from our Excel spreadsheets.  I realy like the feature that lets me populate something and then export that data into Excel. In Excel I can quickly add more rows of same type of information and then import it back into Device42. We have also started to leverage the welldocumented and powerfull API. The ability to add custom fields helps you to make sure you can add business specific information.Cons: The autodiscovery features are really powerfull and sometimes picks up unneaded information. An improvment here would be to bbe able to exclude som information and connections.Reviewer Source Source: CapterraMarch 22, 2019"

Solid customer support.”Pros: For us, Device42 is really one of the best data center infrastructure management  platform out there in terms of flexibility. It's extensive RESTful API offers wonderful possibilities and has allowed us to integrate into our internal systems as well as a number of other areas in our organization including VMware vRealize Automation It's a highly accessible inventory and asset management application that offers a lot of functionality with minimal hassle and a reasonable cost. And the best part is it just keeps getting better with every iteration.  Cons: At the moment, bringing up connections on a single device or rack can be done easily without a hitch, but we'd like to see more of it in a much larger scale. Their customer support has been really good though in addressing all other issues and they promised to get back to us if this gets included in development.

We can track rack information, including what devices are where, power loads, and physical connectivity to each device and through patch panels.Pros: Having information about our remote rack space documented and easily accessible has been a boon, especially when we need to request 3rd party remote hand  to make simple changes for us.  I think last month we needed a small change, and I was able to pull out Device42 and follow a set of cables through 2 patch panels in order to provide precise instructions on cable changes I wanted completed by the technician providing the remote hands.  Cons: We are currently primarily using Device42 to track remote sites on how things are situated in racks and how everything is interconnected at the site.  One thing I feel they could improve for the future is the extraction of physical connectivity information from their software.  I would love to be able to see a full holistic view of the physical interconnections throughout one room, or a building. At the moment its easy to bring up interconnections on a single device, or a single rack, but nothing on a grander scale.  I've spoken with support and they said they'll mention this to development to see if this is on the road map.  Reviewer Source Source: CapterraNovember 22, 2017"

It's ability to integrate with so many other products through it's open API was a key reason for purchase. I love the ability to make mass changes to devices by exporting the data out to a spreadsheet format and re-importing versus having to touch each device individually.  Cons: There are a few limitations to the current version of the product but support has been wonderful to deal with and they truly listen to their customers requests for future functionality.  We are still learning the product so I can't speak on all functions as of yet. Building single scan jobs to encompass, SNMP v2/3 as well as SSH would be great versus having to build 3 different scans for the same subnet space.  I'd like to see IPAM show all IP addresses for a particular subnet showing both used and unused IP's. Currently it will just show you used so you need to scan through and look for a break in the sequence versus looking for an IP with a green bubble showing it's available.  These are small Cons and definitely not a show stopper for us. Just nice to haves.Reviewer Source Source: CapterraNovember 16, 2017"

Having one tool to manage all this information simplifies everything  and makes it easier to update everything .  One pane of glass as they say.  Pros: When I first started using Device42 I was impressed with how helpful the sales team was in the deployment process.  Once deployed I noticed how many tools were included in the base software.  In the first few weeks after deployment in our data centers we needed to quickly run an inventory of all of our SSL certificates.  Using Device42 we were able to run in an automated scan that gave us a report that we used to update all of our SSL certificates.  The more you use the software the more things that can be useful for you company.  I can also say that their support is top notch and always willing to help and work with you until your problem is fixed.  Cons: There is not much to complain about when it comes to this software.

With the feature set included with the product, we ended up with a very powerful tool that has fulfilled needs way above and beyond our initial project scope, and at a fraction of the price of other competing products.    If you are looking for an ITAM system, and you don't at least do a Proof of Concept rollout of Device42, you're making a mistake.  Pros: The feature set for Device42 is fantastic, we were pricing out only ITAM systems when we came across the product line, and for less money than any of the other ITAM systems we looked at, Device42 came with an ITAM, IPAM, a software licensing tool, and a support team that actually answers questions and provides access to live agents rather than some anonymous support team.    Their support people are great, even for casually emailed questions to their support address, I get actual responses (not just a canned ""We got your email"" response) in typically a couple hours.    They have helped me a TON with setting up the software, which is amazingly helpful in tempering the only ""con"" we have found with Device42 so far (more on that below).  Cons: We have been using Device42 for a few months now, an the only ""complaint"" I would say that I have found is that the setup was very involved, and required substantial support from the Device42 support team.

It came with a lot unique functionality we were looking for such as SAML, Jira Integration, workflows etc. What really made my life easier though was their thorough documentation on everything and their very timely and knowledgeable support. Their support was fantastic throughout the implementation process and always addressed issues expediently.  I deal with many organizations support for various solutions we have and D42 definitely stands out for quality. I would definitely recommend their solution based on the above. Cons: This isn't really a con but currently they only have an On-prem option. Overall though hosting it hasn't been much work involved.Reviewer Source Source: CapterraDecember 21, 2017"

Most DCIM's require extensive training, professional services, and lots of ongoing help. Not Device42 - it is intuitive and easy enough to use - if you take time to listen and learn. When we were stumped, a quick support request on their portal was answered quickly.Pros: It is easy to use, and the support folks will work with you to find a root cause - and stick with it. Great Support!Cons: We were told that most APC UPS's were supported, but we had problems with a few of their devices. In the end, Device42 did a program rewrite and corrected everything. Well Done! Recommendations to other buyers: Don't overspend on another DCIM product that provides less for more. Try Device42 and see for yourself.Reviewer Source Source: CapterraSeptember 19, 2017"
